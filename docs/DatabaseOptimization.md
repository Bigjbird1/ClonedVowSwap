# Database Optimization for VowSwap

This document outlines the database optimization strategy implemented for VowSwap, focusing on performance improvements for the marketplace's database operations.

## Overview

As a marketplace for wedding items, VowSwap relies heavily on database operations for listing searches, user interactions, order management, and analytics. Optimizing these operations is critical for providing a responsive user experience, especially as the platform scales.

## Key Optimizations

### 1. Database Indexes

We've added strategic indexes to improve query performance across the platform:

```sql
-- Indexes for listings table
CREATE INDEX idx_listings_category ON listings(category);
CREATE INDEX idx_listings_condition ON listings(condition);
CREATE INDEX idx_listings_price ON listings(price);
CREATE INDEX idx_listings_created_at ON listings(created_at);
CREATE INDEX idx_listings_user_id ON listings(user_id);

-- Composite indexes for common search patterns
CREATE INDEX idx_listings_category_condition ON listings(category, condition);
CREATE INDEX idx_listings_category_price ON listings(category, price);
CREATE INDEX idx_listings_user_id_status ON listings(user_id, status);

-- Full-text search index
CREATE INDEX idx_listings_title_description_gin ON listings USING gin(to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || description));
```

### 2. Query Optimization

We've optimized database queries throughout the application:

- Using appropriate WHERE clauses to leverage indexes
- Limiting result sets to necessary columns
- Implementing pagination for large result sets
- Using JOINs efficiently

### 3. Connection Pooling

The application uses connection pooling to efficiently manage database connections:

- Reusing connections to reduce overhead
- Configuring appropriate pool sizes
- Implementing connection timeouts

## Performance Benefits

### 1. Faster Search Results

- Category and condition filtering is now significantly faster
- Price range queries perform better
- Full-text search is optimized for wedding-specific terminology

### 2. Improved Listing Management

- Seller's listings load faster
- Status updates are more responsive
- Creation timestamps are indexed for efficient sorting

### 3. Enhanced Order Processing

- Order history queries are optimized
- Payment status lookups are faster
- Shipping tracking updates are more efficient

## Implementation Details

### Index Strategy

Our indexing strategy follows these principles:

1. **Index high-cardinality columns** used in WHERE clauses
2. **Create composite indexes** for common query patterns
3. **Index columns used for sorting** (ORDER BY)
4. **Use specialized indexes** for text search

### Query Patterns

We've optimized for these common query patterns:

1. **Category-based browsing**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM listings WHERE category = 'wedding_dress' ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;
   ```

2. **Multi-filter searches**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM listings 
   WHERE category = 'wedding_dress' 
   AND condition = 'like_new' 
   AND price BETWEEN 100 AND 500
   ORDER BY created_at DESC LIMIT 20;
   ```

3. **User-specific queries**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM listings WHERE user_id = '123' AND status = 'active';
   ```

4. **Full-text search**
   ```sql
   SELECT * FROM listings 
   WHERE to_tsvector('english', title || ' ' || description) @@ to_tsquery('english', 'vintage & lace');
   ```

## Monitoring and Maintenance

### Query Performance Monitoring

We monitor query performance using:

- Query execution time tracking
- Slow query logging
- Regular EXPLAIN ANALYZE reviews

### Index Maintenance

To maintain optimal index performance:

- Regularly analyze tables to update statistics
- Monitor index usage to identify unused indexes
- Reindex when necessary to prevent bloat

## Usage Guidelines

### When to Add New Indexes

Consider adding new indexes when:

- A new query pattern emerges that isn't covered by existing indexes
- Performance monitoring shows slow queries
- New features require different data access patterns

### When to Avoid Indexes

Be cautious about adding indexes when:

- The table is very small
- The column has low cardinality (few unique values)
- The table has very frequent writes compared to reads

## Running the Performance Migration

To apply the database optimizations:

```bash
npm run migrate:performance
```

Or use the shorthand:

```bash
npm run optimize
```

This will run the migration script that adds all the necessary indexes to improve query performance.

## Future Optimizations

Planned database optimizations:

1. **Partitioning**: For very large tables (e.g., listings, analytics)
2. **Materialized Views**: For complex analytics queries
3. **Query Caching**: For frequently accessed, relatively static data
4. **Read Replicas**: For scaling read operations
5. **Sharding**: For horizontal scaling as the platform grows

## Measuring Impact

The impact of these optimizations can be measured by:

- Reduced query execution times
- Improved page load times
- Lower database CPU utilization
- Better scalability under load

We've observed significant improvements in search performance, especially for filtered category browsing and full-text searches, which are critical for the wedding marketplace experience.
